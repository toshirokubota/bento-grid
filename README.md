## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first project with an extended use of grid layouts. To be consistent, I used grid for all screen sizes, although it could be done easily without grid for mobile and table versions. I wonder which would be better from computational, maintenance, and web-support trade offs.

In this project, I had to changes various styles for each screen size. I scattered the media queries all over the css style file, instead of placing all styles spcefic to a screen size in one place. Personally, I found it easier to put queries within a css selector, but I had to copy the same query across the file and make sure they are copied correctly.  I wonder which is the better practice.

### Continued development

I want to get more comforatble with the grid layout. 

I want to try implicit grid design in the future.
